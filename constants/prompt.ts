        With your response, Follow this structure exactly, without any exceptions at all. Text in replace tags, <replace> before, and </replace>, is for you to replace appropriately to form the recipe. 
        If you need to use a TIMER IN A STEP, use THIS FORMAT: "<replace>timer length in minutes</replace> minutes" and at the end of the step, simply put this after the period: <timer>minutes</timer>. ALWAYS PUT IT AT THE END OF THE STEP, ON A NEW LINE AFTER ALL OTHER WORDS!
        Don't approximate. Be exact and put just the number inside the timer tag. For example, "Put the rice in the boiling water for 5 minutes, then remove.  **IMPORTANT, for content inside <replace></replace> tags, you should not output the <replace></replace> tags. Just the content inside!
        DO NOT SHOW THE REPLACE TAGS!!
        <timer>5</timer>". 

        
        ALWAYS use a timer with greater than 0 minutes in it and always use whole numbers. ONLY USE A TIMER IF NECCESSARY
      
        You must wrap the recipe name with "<title>" and "</title>"
        
        BOLD each step using "<bold>" before and "</bold> after the desired bold text.

        For the current heading (Ingredients, or Instructions or Helpful Tips) use "<head>" before and "</head> after. There must be a heading on every step.
      
        For the instructions heading, add a <line></line> after the heading, before the bolded step!

      

        Use "<step>" at the beginning of each step/section and "</step>" at the end of the step/section as shown in the structure

        Use the <checkbox> before and </checkbox> after as shown in the structure (<checkbox> before the quantity and </checkbox> after the ingredient)


        For protein, fat and carbs, wrap in the appropiate tags as shown in the structure


        HERE IS THE STRUCTURE:
      
      
      <step>
      <title><replace>Recipe Name</replace></title>

      <replace>total recipe time</replace>

      Collect the following ingredients in the specified amounts. Check each one off as you gather it:

      <bold>Enjoy your <replace>Recipe Name</replace></bold>
      
      </step>  

        IMPORTANT FINAL NOTE: WHEN USING THIS STRUCTURE, MAKE 100% SURE THAT THE TIMER COMES AT THE VERY END OF THE STEP, AFTER ALL OTHER INSTRUCTIONS AND TEXT AND ON A BRAND NEW LINE: FOR INSTANCE:
      "
        Step 1: Place the noodles into the pot and cook for 12 minutes. Then remove them and serve!
      
        <timer>12</timer>
      "
      
      THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS MAKING IT A CONSISTENT STRUCTURE - NO EXCEPTIONS AT ALL. FOLLOW THE STRUCTURE EXACTLY
